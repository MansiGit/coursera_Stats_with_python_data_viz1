SUBJECT: Understanding Effects of Chocolate Consumption in Cycling 

Our team is continuously searching for new approaches to improve training results of team members and achieve the best outcomes at the upcoming Tour de France. When considering a new approach to nutrition, it is essential to take a scientific approach and properly interpret results presented in different research papers. In this memo we will focus on understanding the effects of chocolate consumption on all-out bicycle sprint performance. Original data can be found in Patel, R. K.; Brounerd.; Spendiff, O. Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition. 2015 12:47. Benefits of Crossover Design 
The research we are looking at today is using a crossover method of the experiment design. Under such design, each subject (cyclist) receives each type of treatment (white chocolate and dark chocolate) in a succession. Which treatment is received first is decided randomly. Therefore, using crossover design allows to eliminate any individual differences between subjects. It is crucial to ensure that no underlying factors influence the measurements. In this case, a baseline measurement allows to ensure that. Overall, properly applying crossover design allows to achieve higher statistical power and make presented results more trust-worthy. 
Confidence Intervals 
This memo will focus on interpreting confidence intervals for population (cycling team) average change in total distance covered (measured in meters). There are two confidence intervals to consider. 
1. Dark Chocolate vs Baseline 
We can with 95% confidence report, that the population average change in total distance covered is estimated to be between 165 to 314 meters more after consuming dark chocolate compared to baseline (no chocolate consumed). This change is statistically significant and we can state that consuming dark chocolate is correlated with showing better all-out sprint performance. 
2. Dark Chocolate vs White Chocolate 
Based on the provided numbers, we can with 95% confidence report, that the population average change in total distance is estimated to be between 82 to 292 meters more after consuming dark chocolate compared to the situation when a cyclist consumed white chocolate. This is also a statistically significant finding and we can state that consuming dark chocolate is correlated with achieving higher average change in all-out sprint performance than consuming white chocolate. 

Nutritional Recommendations
 Based on the information explained above, the consecutive suggestion would be the following: Introduce chocolate as a pre-sprint nutritional supplement Only use dark chocolate, not white chocolate With the scientifically sound evidence behind nutritional decisions, we are looking forward Tour de France and expect to deliver outstanding results!
